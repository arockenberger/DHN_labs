## Ideas / Notes

### Conference Topic for DHNB2022

*Digital research infrastructures for humanities and social sciences*

### Ideas

There are different types of 'infrastructures' - or support units - for digital humanities research in the Nordic and Baltic Countries. This is, in fact, neither new nor specific for the North. However, as there are more and more of these units forming, especially within or closely attached to libraries, it seems worthwhile to get an overview of the units, their scope, target audiences, areas of research support, teaching, core functions, whether they are projects or long-term funded, etc. We will also take into account how commonalities and differences between the individual countries, with some of them developing national and supra-institutional infrastructures, while others spring independent units with a more informal collaboration.

The aim of this workshop is to gather the coordinators and drivers of such infrastructures (networking – Digital Humanities in Libraries, Archives and Museums Working Group (DHLAM)) in the Nordic and Baltic Countries. As a group, we will map DH infrastructures according to the following, preliminary, parameters. The concrete output of the workshop will be an interactive map of DH infrastructures and how they can supplement each other within national and transnational contexts.

How is DH research - and teaching - supported in the Nordic and Baltic Countries? Which are the institutions - and which are the concrete units at these institutions - that support DH. How do they organise the support? Who is supported (researchers, staff, students; public; affiliates w/ institutions or anyone)? Is access to digital collections provided? Are trainings provided? Are trainings/support provided outside the scope of the institutions collections? Is dissimeniation of DH research part of the support (events hosted, exhibitions, show-cases, blogs, podcasts, videos)? Physical location: use of equipment, computers, hardware, "lab"-facilities; books/analog media; space, furniture, etc. Virtual location: software (licensed, working station), common work-space online, chat/videochat/discord, social media interaction. Rogue units vs. long-term integrated units (cf. policy; bottom-up / top-down). Staff and background/training? Research initiated by/lead by DH unit / authorship/contributions to research/representation as contributors? For free service / paid service? Relation to DH researchers/students/practitioners?


Support and training in relation to researchers/students/practitioners at the institution and outside of that institution: How are the needs of the research milieus mapped to offer best possible support?
The place of the humanities: Are fields outside of the humanities considered as well to open up an interdisciplinary discourse on digital methods?
Affiliation to other infrastructures (common trainings?)

##### What was the outcome?


We need to be clear with the scope of this workshop and the types of infrastructure we are looking at. Especially "what does not count" needs to be handled with care.

#### What counts as an infrastructure?

- DH Lab
- DH Center
- DH Hub
- DH unit
- can be physical and/or virtual
- DH Research group? (intuition: No)
- DH network (no formal unit: No)
-

#### What counts as DH?

- broad definition, incl. Humanities and Social Sciences, but also Arts
- Digital Research methods + digital research activities (cf. TaDiRAH)
- Digital Culture (digital being the object of research)?
- units which serve any research field that has DRM/DRA needs, but not exclusively Humanities/SoSci?

#### What counts as Libraries, Archives, and Museums Sector?

- National level
  - National Library
  - National Archives
  - National Museum
- University level
  - University Library
  - University Archives or similar unit
  - University Museums
- State level, Municipality level
- Research ALMs / Special Collections ALMS

#### What does not count?

- "Super infrastructures" (CLARIN, DARIAH), national infrastructures (SWECLARIN, eLAM)
- general IT at Faculties, university central IT
- mere research networks (i.e. without any funding, mandate, etc.) (DHOslo)
- DH research groups, where DH is the object of research or the research result (i.e. ELMCIP)
- mere EdTech

### Format

full-day, online (Zoom)

Short presentations of DH infrastructures in lightning talks, where a couple of key questions should be addressed (list questions below).
After that, participants work together in groups; first based on Nation and gather information regarding the DH infrastructures, key people, etc., second based on type of unit/hosting institution, focusing on subjects, target audiences, etc.

The groups do a short presentation of their findings (what's common / what's different).

The plenum comes up with further To-Dos, interesting questions, etc.

Host function
Facilitator function
Group facilitators
Shared documents (G-Suite)
Multilinguality is encouraged
Zoom w/ break out rooms
Padlet etc. for creative thinking


#### Output
