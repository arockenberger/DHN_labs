### Title

Digital Humanities Support Units in the Nordic and Baltic Countries

### Short Description

DHN2019 saw the founding of the working group for Digital Humanities at Libraries, Archives and Museums right after the British Library Lab had sparked a global movement of so-called GLAM-Labs and many National Libraries, Archives and Museums joined in. Since then, a guide on how to Open A GLAM-Lab @maheyOpenGLAMLab2019 has been published and big and small lab-like units have been springing up all over the place. While the focus of the previous workshop was on how the ALM sector in the Nordic and Baltic Countries has opened up its cultural heritage collections digitally to both its peoples and researchers, students, and activists internationally, the workshop for DHNB2022 will take a closer look at the concrete units and the infrastructure they create to support, foster, carry out, and preserve Digital Humanities research.

The aim of this workshop is to gather the coordinators and drivers of DH support units at ALM institutions in the Nordic and Baltic Countries for an exchange of experience, for much needed discussions, and exploring options for collaboration as well as delimitation. Thus, the individual units will become visible as parts of greater network of DH in practice and will become recognisable as an emerging supra-national infrastructure. A representative selection of DH support units from the different DHNB countries present themselves with lightning talks. The workshop participants will then work together mapping out Nordic and Baltic DH units at ALM institutions according to a set of parameters previously agreed on. A tentative list of parameters could be:

How is DH research - and teaching - supported in the Nordic and Baltic Countries? Which are the institutions - and which are the concrete units at these institutions - that support DH? How do they organise the support? Who is supported (researchers, staff, students; public; affiliates w/ institutions or anyone)? Is access to digital collections provided? Are trainings provided? Are trainings/support provided outside the scope of the institutions collections? Is dissemination of DH research part of the support (events hosted, exhibitions, show-cases, blogs, podcasts, videos)? Is there a physical location? Is there use of equipment, computers, hardware, "lab"-facilities; books/analog media; space, furniture, etc.? Is there a virtual/online presence? Is software (licensed, working station) provided, a common work-space online, chat/video-chat/discord, social media interaction. Are these 'rogue' units, as a reaction to a imminent demand, formed outside of an institutions mandate or framwork or are they fixed-term or even long-term, integrated units (cf. policy; bottom-up / top-down)? What about staff and background/training? Is research initiated by/lead by DH unit? What about authorship/contributions to research/representation as contributors? Is the support for free or a paid service? How is the relation of the unit to DH researchers/students/practitioners at the institution and outside of that institution?

The concrete output of the workshop will be an interactive map of DH support units and how they might supplement each other within national and transnational contexts. The map will be published via the DHNB website and will serve as a supplement to [similar but outdated map provided by CenterNet](https://dhcenternet.org/), and the [overview provided by the EADH](https://eadh.org/education/digital-humanities-centres). Additionally, the short presentations will be made accessible online and expanded with short descriptions of those units that could not be presented as well as new units that are yet to be launched. Finally, the outcome of the discussions and the mapping will be collected in a written report to be published in 2022 as a collective work by all participants describing the status quo of the Nordic and Baltic DH infrastructures provided by the ALM sector.

The DHLAM working group will have the responsibility of curating the map of DH units and keeping the information about them up to date and foster a good flow of communication between the individual units.

## Ideas / Notes

### Conference Topic for DHNB2022

*Digital research infrastructures for humanities and social sciences*

### Ideas

There are different types of 'infrastucutres' - or support units - for digital humanities research in the Nordic and Baltic Countries. This is, in fact, neither new nor specific for the North. However, as there are more and more of these units forming, especially within or closely attached to libraries, it seems worthwhile to get an overview of the units, their scope, target audiences, areas of research suppport, teaching, core functions, whether they are projects or long-term funded, etc. We will also take into account how commonalities and diffrences between the individual countries, with some of them developing national and supra-institutional infrastructures, while others spring independent units with a more informal collaboration.

The aim of this workshop is to gather the coordinators and drivers of such infrastructures (networking – Digital Humanities in Libraries, Archives and Museums Working Group (DHLAM)) in the Nordic and Baltic Countries. As a group, we will map DH infrastructures according to the following, preliminary, parameters. The concrete output of the workshop will be an interactive map of DH infrastructures and how they can supplement each other within national and transnational contexts.

How is DH research - and teaching - supported in the Nordic and Baltic Countries? Which are the institutions - and which are the concrete units at these institutions - that support DH. How do they organise the support? Who is supported (researchers, staff, students; public; affiliates w/ institutions or anyone)? Is access to digital collections provided? Are trainings provided? Are trainings/support provided outside the scope of the institutions collections? Is dissimeniation of DH research part of the support (events hosted, exhibitions, show-cases, blogs, podcasts, videos)? Physical location: use of equipment, computers, hardware, "lab"-facilities; books/analog media; space, furniture, etc. Virtual location: software (licensed, working station), common work-space online, chat/videochat/discord, social media interaction. Rogue units vs. long-term integrated units (cf. policy; bottom-up / top-down). Staff and background/training? Research initiated by/lead by DH unit / authorship/contributions to research/representation as contributors? For free service / paid service? Relation to DH researchers/students/practitioners?

[Workshop repo on GitHub](https://github.com/arockenberger/DHN_labs)

##### What was the outcome?


We need to be clear with the scope of this workshop and the types of infrastructure we are looking at. Especially "what does not count" needs to be handled with care.

#### What counts as an infrastructure?

- DH Lab
- DH Center
- DH Hub
- DH unit
- can be physical and/or virtual
- DH Research group? (intuition: No)
- DH network (no formal unit: No)
-

#### What counts as DH?

- broad definition, incl. Humanities and Social Sciences, but also Arts
- Digital Research methods + digital research activities (cf. TaDiRAH)
- Digital Culture (digital being the object of research)?
- units which serve any research field that has DRM/DRA needs, but not exclusively Humanities/SoSci?

#### What counts as Libraries, Archives, and Museums Sector?

- National level
  - National Library
  - National Archives
  - National Museum
- University level
  - University Library
  - University Archives or similar unit
  - University Museums
- State level, Municipality level
- Research ALMs / Special Collections ALMS

#### What does not count?

- "Super infrastructures" (CLARIN, DARIAH), national infrastructures (SWECLARIN, eLAM)
- general IT at Faculties, university central IT
- mere research networks (i.e. without any funding, mandate, etc.) (DHOslo)
- DH research groups, where DH is the object of research or the research result (i.e. ELMCIP)
- mere EdTech
