## DHLAM: Scope and Purpose

One of the key drivers of Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries has been the LAM sector: Libraries, archives, and museums. Early on, they have been digitising their vast collections, providing access to metadata, digital facsimiles of the items in their holdings, and machine-readable digital representations of their collections. They have been pioneering large-scale digitisation and low-threshold access to the copious amounts of data they are curating. At the same time, LAM institutions have been early providers of digital skill development, offering training for researchers, students, and the general public in how to make use of and creatively build upon their digital collections.

With the recent rise in activity around Digital Humanities labs, centres, hubs - and a general expansion of digital humanities support for research and teaching at LAM institutions, we recognise the need for interconnecting the Nordic and Baltic LAM sector. We see the need for creating a virtual meeting space for those working at LAM institutions hosting digital collections, providing access to digital holdings, supporting research projects, and training researchers, students, and the general public.

The WG "Digital Humanities in Libraries, Archives, and Museums", short DHLAM, proposes that meeting space, both virtually and physically. The WG aims to actively connect institutions and people within the field, to foster the free exchange of experiences, ideas, and visions and thus to actively support the primary purpose of DHNB, that is, to "support research, education, and dissemination of Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries".
